Data Science Internship Assignment
This repository contains my submission for the Data Science Internship Assignment, which analyzes the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using two key datasets. The entire project is contained within a single Jupyter notebook, following the specified submission format.

Project Structure
The project is structured according to the assignment's guidelines, ensuring a clean and organized repository:

ds_<candidate_name>
/

├── notebook_1.ipynb

├── csv_files/

├── outputs/

└── README.md

notebook_1.ipynb: The primary Jupyter notebook, which contains all the code for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

csv_files/: This directory is used to store any intermediate or processed data files.

outputs/: All visual outputs, such as graphs or charts generated during the analysis, are saved here.

README.md: This document, providing a comprehensive overview and instructions for the project.

Analysis Objective
The core objective of this project is to investigate how trading behavior—including profitability, risk, volume, and leverage—correlates with overall market sentiment, categorized as either "Fear" or "Greed." The notebook aims to uncover hidden trends or signals that could be used to develop smarter trading strategies.

How to Run the Notebook
This project was developed and is best viewed in Google Colab. The notebook is designed to run seamlessly in that environment.

Prerequisites
All necessary Python libraries are handled automatically by the Google Colab environment. They include:

pandas: For robust data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For high-performance numerical operations.

gdown: To enable the automatic downloading of the datasets from Google Drive.

Steps
Open the Internship_assingment (3).ipynb file directly in Google Colab.

Once loaded, navigate to the "Runtime" menu and select "Run all."

The notebook will then automatically execute all cells: it will download the required datasets, perform the analysis, and display all visualizations and results.
