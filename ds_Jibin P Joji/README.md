Data Science Internship Assignment
This repository contains my submission for the Data Science Internship Assignment. The project's objective is to explore and analyze the relationship between trader behavior and market sentiment using two key datasets. The work is presented in a single Jupyter notebook, following the specified submission format.

Project Structure
This repository is structured according to the assignment's guidelines:

ds_<candidate_name>/
├── notebook_1.ipynb
├── csv_files/
├── outputs/
└── README.md

notebook_1.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

csv_files/: A directory for any intermediate or processed data files.

outputs/: A directory for visual outputs, such as graphs or charts, generated during the analysis.

README.md: This file, which provides an overview and instructions.

Analysis Objective
The core goal of this project is to analyze how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment (classified as "Fear" or "Greed"). The notebook aims to identify trends or signals that could influence smarter trading strategies.

How to Run the Notebook
This project was developed in Google Colab, and the notebook is designed to be run in that environment.

Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries installed, which are handled automatically within Google Colab:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

gdown: For downloading the datasets from Google Drive.

Steps
Open the Internship_assingment (3).ipynb file in Google Colab.

Once the notebook is loaded, navigate to the "Runtime" menu and select "Run all".

The notebook will automatically download the necessary datasets, perform the analysis, and display the results, including visualizations.
