Welcome to my Data Wizardry! Here, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. I use tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to derive insights from data and solve real-world problems. Each project includes a detailed walkthrough of the analysis process, insights generated, and the techniques applied. Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out with any questions or collaboration ideas!
